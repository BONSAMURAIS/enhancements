# BONSAI enhancement proposals

A BONSAI enhancement proposal (BEP) is a formal decision-making system adapted from other enhancement proposals used widely in software development. A BEP allows the community to examine and debate alternatives, and reach consensus on foundational and controversial decisions.

The governance structure of the BONSAI project, including the BEP process, is given in [BEP 2](https://github.com/BONSAMURAIS/enhancements/blob/master/beps/0002-bonsai-project-community-governance-structure.md).
