## Abstract

A short (less than 200 word) description of the issue being addressed.

The `Abstract` section is important for producing high quality user-focused documentation such as release notes or a development roadmap.

## Motivation

Clearly explain why the existing specifications is inadequate to address the problem that the BEP solves

## Proposal

Detailed description of the proposed idea of solution. Normative statements should follow [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). Must include include the following subsections (some of which are optional); additional sections may be added:

The proposal does not need to be exhaustive, if the proposed standards or software are otherwise available and well documented, especially as part of the BONSAMURAIS repository.

### Rationale

Mandatory. Describe why particular design decisions were made.

### Pros and Cons

Optional. May be free-form text or bullet lists

### Alternatives

Mandatory. Ideas that were not ultimately selected

### Open Issues

Optional. Relevant issues or questions not governed or resolved by this BEP

### Non-Goals

Optional. Listing non-goals helps to focus discussion and make progress

### Test plan and results

Mandatory. How can one show the usefulness of the proposal in practice? The test phase must be completed and results documented **before** the BEP vote.

## BEP metadata

The BEP header table should contain the following:

* Number: Integer number, also used in the filename. Self-assigned ascending integers starting from 1.
* Title: This is the title of the KEP. Keep it simple and descriptive.
* Status: One of:
    * draft: Incomplete proposal being worked on by the authors and editor
    * proposed: Complete proposal open for discussion by the community, or being voted on
    * deferred: Complete proposal not currently under public discussion
    * accepted
    * rejected
    * withdrawn
    * superseded
* Type: One of:
    * Software features: Describes a new feature or implementation for BONSAI.
    * Guidelines: Provides general guidelines or information to the BONSAI community, but does not propose a new feature.

* Version: Ascending integer number starting from 1
* Replaces: **Optional** row if this BEP replaces an existing proposal
* Superseded by: **Optional** row if this BEP has itself been replaced

Note that the BEP process is governed by [BEP 3: BONSAI project community governance structure].

## Discussion

A comprehensive bullet list of link to where the BEP has been discussed by the community, such as the BONSAI mailing list, and Github pull requests and issues. For example, this template is discussed in:

* the BONSAI group.io discussion list, tagged with [#BEP0001](https://bonsai.groups.io/g/main/topic/30394665?p=,,,20,0,0,0::relevance,,%23bep0001,20,2,0,30394665,ct=1&ct=1)

A procedure to implement/reject modifications to the BEP shall be mentioned in the proposal. Depending on the type of BEP, examples can be one or more of the following options:

* BEP result of working groups already reflect some level of consensus, and will have a history of how the specifics came to be. In this case, the author will mention that the group is the primary and preliminary place for discussing the proposal, before it is made public.
* Once the BEP is public, the authors implement the suggested changes if they do not object or motivate the rejection on the respective BEP discussion list. Since the proposal has to be agreed by the broader community, it is in the interest of the authors to agree to reasonable change requests - otherwise the proposal won't survive a vote.
* Depending on the BEP, the author may chose to invite anyone to suggest a structured change via pull request to be voted by the community. Note tha this could lead to vote overload and it should therefore be used only when necessary. Fewer votes would mean that people pay more attention when they come up.
* The author or the editor may invite the participant in the discussion to a call with the objective to reach consensus if this has not been reached yet in the within agreed or due time.
