## Abstract

The goal of this effort is to organise the Bonsai mediums such that interested people can quickly navigate to the most up-to-date information which is relevant for them. This way they are more likely to properly understand the project without unnecessary struggle. Once they have this understanding, their path toward meaningful contributions should also be clear.

## Motivation

There are currently too many communication channels separate places for digitally documenting/storing our combined knowledge. It is  hard for newcomers to get started, and for active participants to know where each type of information should reside.

As of the writing of this proposal, there are the following:

* The bonsai.uno website
* The 'main' mailing list on groups.io and the hackathon sub-group
* BONSAMURAIS organization on Github, plus repositories
* A slack workspace
* A google docs folder _(recently deprecated)_
* A LinkedIn company and closed group _(recently deprecated)_

## Proposal

This BEP proposes guidelines for knowledge management and communication. A specific use-case for each of three mediums is described: the Web-page, mailing list, and GitHub (with sub-sections). 

The scope of this proposal is limited to written, publicly accessible knowledge and communication mediums. Private communications including video/phone calls, personal emails, and messenging applications are beyond scope. 

All action points already discussed publicly and committed-to-acting-upon by Michele De Rosa ([here])https://bonsai.groups.io/g/main/message/13_) are excluded. Discussions regarding LinkedIn (at a board meeting) and Google Docs ([here](https://bonsai.groups.io/g/main/topic/30174153?p=,,,20,0,0,0::recentpostdate,,,20,2,0,0&allview=1)) have already been completed (with the decision to deprecate their usage), and are hence also omitted from this proposal.

### The BONSAI web page bonsai.uno

The web page currently has the following pages:

* Landing page, https://bonsai.uno/: Brief introduction, buttons for downloading short presentation and contributing, links to subpages
* Challenge and vision, https://bonsai.uno/challenge-vision/: A global challenge, a global vision
* Organization, https://bonsai.uno/organisation/: Description as NPO, links to statutes, minutes, board
* Strategy work plan, https://bonsai.uno/strategy-work-plan/: Graphic of data flow, links to many working groups
* 10 specific working group detail pages under https://bonsai.uno/strategy-work-plan/
* Contribute, https://bonsai.uno/contribute/: Form to give donations or become a member
* Subpages for contributing: https://bonsai.uno/contribute/payment/, https://bonsai.uno/contribute/donation/

Proposed action (in addition to [these](https://bonsai.groups.io/g/main/message/13_)): 
The BONSAI web page source code should be made public as a Github repo under the BONSAMURAIS organization, enabling updates via pull requests.


### The BONSAI wiki

The wiki becomes the primary destination for up-to-date information, with only stable information on the website (plus eventually the web-apps).

Use the Github 'Projects' functionality for task management.

* When tasks relate to specific repos, use the 'projects' in those.
* For higher-level tasks or ones that presently lack repositories, use the top-level Bonsai organisation 'projects'

Update the wiki front-page (or make a dedicated page) with the outcome of this discussion.

a.       use this as the general "contributing guidelines" (or similar) for the organisation. Stating how we agree to use the various comms mediums and tools such as GitHub Issues etc.
b.       This becomes the basis for the #GettingStarted guide referenced by Chris

Add any missing information from the website-hosted strategy and work plan to the wiki. Then delete these webpages.

Move the 5 pages of tasks to appropriate GitHub organisation or repository Project Boards



### The LinkedIn group

Pursuant to a decision by the BONSAI NPO board, the LinkedIn account will be archived (i.e. no longer actively used with a redirect message) in June 2019.

Detailed description of the proposed idea of solution. Normative statements should follow [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). Must include include the following subsections (some of which are optional); additional sections may be added:

The proposal does not need to be exhaustive, if the proposed standards or software are otherwise available and well documented, especially as part of the BONSAMURAIS repository.

### Rationale

Mandatory. Describe why particular design decisions were made.

### Pros and Cons

Optional. May be free-form text or bullet lists

### Alternatives

Mandatory. Ideas that were not ultimately selected

### Open Issues

Optional. Relevant issues or questions not governed or resolved by this BEP

### Test plan

Mandatory. How can one show the usefulness of the proposal in practice?

## Discussion

A comprehensive bullet list of link to where the BEP has been discussed by the community, such as the BONSAI mailing list, and Github pull requests and issues. For example, this template is discussed in:
