## Abstract

A short statement of the core principles of the BONSAI project.

## Proposal



### Motivation

Similar to [PEP 20](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), a short statement of the core principles can be an important guide for BONSAI newcomers and experienced developers.

### Rationale

These principles were derived from personal experiences, reflections on the existing BONSAI and general life cycle assessment literature, and lessons learned from interaction with existing industrial ecology data, databases, and models.

### Alternatives

A more detailed or verbose set of principles was explicitly rejected as being too complicated or difficult to process; overlapping too much with the getting-started guide; and harder to reach community consensus.

### Test plan

The BEP structure and process will be tested before and during the 2019 hackathon.
