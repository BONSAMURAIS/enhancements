# BONSAI enhancement proposals

A BONSAI enhancement proposal (BEP) is a formal decision-making system adapted from other enhancement proposals used widely in software development. A BEP allows the community to examine and debate alternatives, and reach consensus on foundational and controversial decisions.

TODO: BEP 0 gives a template and instructions on how to create a BEP.

The governance structure of the BONSAI project, including the BEP process, is given in TODO:BEP 2
