## Abstract

The goal of this effort is to organise the Bonsai mediums such that interested people can quickly navigate to the most up-to-date information which is relevant for them. This way they are more likely to properly understand the project without unnecessary struggle. Once they have this understanding, their path toward meaningful contributions should also be clear.

## Motivation

There are currently too many communication channels, and no easy entrance path for newcomers to get started, nor for active participants to know exactly where to expect certain information to reside.

As of the writing of this proposal, there are the following:

* BONSAMURAIS organization on Github
* Two mailing lists on groups.io
* A LinkedIn company and closed group
* The bonsai.uno website
* A google docs folder
* A slack chat channel

## Proposal

Many changes are needed to make information flow and discovery easier:

### The BONSAI wiki

The wiki becomes the primary destination for up-to-date information, with only stable information on the website (plus eventually the web-apps).

Use the Github 'Projects' functionality for task management.

* When tasks relate to specific repos, use the 'projects' in those.
* For higher-level tasks or ones that presently lack repositories, use the top-level Bonsai organisation 'projects'

Update the wiki front-page (or make a dedicated page) with the outcome of this discussion.

a.       use this as the general "contributing guidelines" (or similar) for the organisation. Stating how we agree to use the various comms mediums and tools such as GitHub Issues etc.
b.       This becomes the basis for the #GettingStarted guide referenced by Chris

Add any missing information from the website-hosted strategy and work plan to the wiki. Then delete these webpages.

Move the 5 pages of tasks to appropriate GitHub organisation or repository Project Boards

### The BONSAI web page bonsai.uno

The web page currently has the following pages:

* Landing page, https://bonsai.uno/: Brief introduction, buttons for downloading short presentation and contributing, links to subpages
* Challenge and vision, https://bonsai.uno/challenge-vision/: A global challenge, a global vision
* Organization, https://bonsai.uno/organisation/: Description as NPO, links to statutes, minutes, board
* Strategy work plan, https://bonsai.uno/strategy-work-plan/: Graphic of data flow, links to many working groups
* 10 specific working group detail pages under https://bonsai.uno/strategy-work-plan/
* Contribute, https://bonsai.uno/contribute/: Form to give donations or become a member
* Subpages for contributing: https://bonsai.uno/contribute/payment/, https://bonsai.uno/contribute/donation/

The BONSAI web page source code should be made public as a Github repo under the BONSAMURAIS organization. Archived documents will be moved from the google docs folder to the web page repo. Add previous funding applications to the same repo.

Add a link to the Groups.io mailing list in the website contact section

Edit the ‘Status and statutes’ section:

a.       ‘Status’ implies up-to-date: hence reference the wiki
b.       ‘Statutes’ are static: with other website-hosted documents

### The LinkedIn group

Pursuant to a decision by the BONSAI NPO board, the LinkedIn account will be archived (i.e. no longer actively used with a redirect message) in June 2019.

Detailed description of the proposed idea of solution. Normative statements should follow [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt). Must include include the following subsections (some of which are optional); additional sections may be added:

The proposal does not need to be exhaustive, if the proposed standards or software are otherwise available and well documented, especially as part of the BONSAMURAIS repository.

### Rationale

Mandatory. Describe why particular design decisions were made.

### Pros and Cons

Optional. May be free-form text or bullet lists

### Alternatives

Mandatory. Ideas that were not ultimately selected

### Open Issues

Optional. Relevant issues or questions not governed or resolved by this BEP

### Test plan

Mandatory. How can one show the usefulness of the proposal in practice?

## Discussion

A comprehensive bullet list of link to where the BEP has been discussed by the community, such as the BONSAI mailing list, and Github pull requests and issues. For example, this template is discussed in:

* the BONSAI group.io discussion list, tagged with [#BEP0001](https://bonsai.groups.io/g/hackathon2019/topic/bep_0001_bonsai_bep/30402593?p=,,,20,0,0,0::recentpostdate%2Fsticky,,,20,2,0,30402593)

## Previous Versions

None.
